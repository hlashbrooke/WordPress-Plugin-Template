A comprehensive code template for any WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

"WordPress Plugin Template" is an object-oriented code template for any kind of WordPress plugin that includes built-in support for:

1. Custom post types with custom fields and custom taxonomies
1. Plugin settings page
1. WPML localisation

Activating this plugin template in your WordPress dashboard will activate a new custom post type (identified as '*Posts' in the menu) as well as a new settings page (found at Settings > Plugin Settings). These pages are for demonstration purposes - all you need to do is edit the files in the plugin where necessary and these pages will reflect your new functionality.

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
